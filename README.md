This is my To-Do List for the CodeNation Week 5 React.js challenge.

These instructions are on the site itself but for the sake of thoroughness, here is the functionality of this project:

There are two lists, TO-DO and COMPLETE. Using the ENTER key or the ADD ITEM button after entering text into the input field will add the item to the TO-DO list.

Clicking the text of an entry on the TO-DO list will cause it to strike through the text, clicking again after the fact will remove the line.

However, double-clicking the text of an entry on the TO-DO list will remove that item entirely.

The EDIT button will allow you to edit the text of the selected entry, and clicking SAVE will apply it.

The COMPLETE button will transfer an entry over to the COMPLETE list.

Double-clicking an entry on the COMPLETE list will remove that entry entirely.

The CLEAR LIST button will clear the respective list.
